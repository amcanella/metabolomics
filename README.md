# Metabolomics
1H NMR spectra simulation based on official databases. 

- By inputting a xlsx or csv file with names, peak parameters and concentrations of metabolites, user can replicate any spectra in low and high field NMRs.
- The script is currently prepared for urine samples as the centre of the peaks will shift.
